# CS50Finance

This is my implementation and solution for CS50's Finance, 2023.

If you want to try it, download and install requirements on requirements.txt.

Could vary on your system but it should work with:

```console
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

And then, inside the project directory:

```console
$ flask run
```
